  My name is Brenda Diaz, I am a Veterinary Assistant at Paws Chicago Clinic . We also have our own shelter where we have pets who have been
  brought from all over the world as rescues . They are in need of families since they have been brought to a new place and have people to meet and owners to get .
  Instead of buying animals from breeders please consider the animals that are for adoption.
  Don't Shop, Adopt!
  Adopting an animal from the shelter has many benefits for not only you but also for animals.

<p>
  Approximately 8 million animals enter shelters every year. And, roughly 2.6 million dogs and cats are killed in U.S. shelters annually.
  Knowing these statistics is alarming, this is why I feel everyone should consider adopting not shopping for pets.
  Audience can learn and gain knowledge on the benefits of adopting animals. This informative flyer will give the audience a new perspective on where to go when looking for an animal.

Think of this scenarion when in doubt of adopting
 Let's say you are going to adopt an animal from a shelter.

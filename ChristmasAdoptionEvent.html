My name is Brenda Diaz, I am a Veterinary Assistant at Paws Chicago Clinic . We also have our own shelter where we have pets who have been
brought from all over the world as rescues . They are in need of families since they have been brought to a new place and have people to meet and owners to get .
Instead of buying animals from breeders please consider the animals that are for adoption.
Don't Shop, Adopt!
Adopting an animal from the shelter has many benefits for not only you but also for animals.

<p>
  Approximately 8 million animals enter shelters every year. And, roughly 2.6 million dogs and cats are killed in U.S. shelters annually.
  Knowing these statistics is alarming, this is why I feel everyone should consider adopting not shopping for pets.
  Audience can learn and gain knowledge on the benefits of adopting animals. This informative flyer will give the audience a new perspective on where to go when looking for an animal.

  Adopting not shopping is greatly advertised on this flyer ,I want you and everyone else to use this alternative option instead of buying from pet stores and mills.
  Think of this scenarion when in doubt of adopting
   Let's say you are going to adopt an animal from a shelter.

</p>

<p>
1) You go through with the adoption process
2) You have a healthy animal
3) You saved yours and other animals lives
4) You did not support puppy mill, You buy an animal from a pet store/ other seller
5) You support the inhumane practice of pet stores/mills
6) Animals in shelters are euthanized because of overcrowding and you do not carry the guilt
7) Your animal lives a better live instead of living in poor conditions that lead to health conditions
